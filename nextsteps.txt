[x] Add synthetic case class <: Any1

[x] Replace Any w/ Any1 in case classes arguments, and their invocations.
[x] Replace references to Any1 in type parameters (FunctionInvocation and CaseClass).
[x] Check WrapAnyExprs and ReplaceAnyWithAny to ensure they traverse lambda and pre-postconditions.
[x] Check why preTraversal doesn't traverse lambda and check explicitely the arguments.

[ ] Figure out why there are still instances of Any (most likely in types).

[~] Write ListAny library.
[x] Add support for higher order functions.

[ ] ScalaJS - Purely Dynamic.
