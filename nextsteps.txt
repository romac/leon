[x] Add synthetic case class <: Any1

[x] Replace Any w/ Any1 in case classes arguments, and their invocations.
[x] Replace references to Any1 in type parameters (FunctionInvocation and CaseClass).
[x] Check WrapAnyExprs and ReplaceAnyWithAny to ensure they traverse lambda and pre-postconditions.
[x] Check why preTraversal doesn't traverse lambda and check explicitely the arguments.

[x] Figure out why there are still instances of Any (most likely in types).

[x] Write ListAny library.
[x] Add support for higher order functions.

[x] Disallow wrapping Sets of Any (same for Arrays and Maps)
[x] Modify verification report to strip Any1 wrappers from the output

[/] Extract selectDynamic and applyDynamic
[/] Have Any1 extend Dynamic

[x] Create an Any1Ops instance at the start of DesugarAnyPhase and pass it to the subphases.

[~] Define operations on implicit class (see https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/blob/master/library/src/main/scala/scala/scalajs/js/Dynamic.scala)
[ ] Desugar calls to methods on that implicit class to pattern matches + actual impl.
